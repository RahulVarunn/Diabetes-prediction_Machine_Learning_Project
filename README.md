#Diabetes Prediction Model Using Logistic Regression

Introduction: This project is a machine learning model that has been developed to predict the likelihood of a person having diabetes based on certain factors. The goal of this project is to provide  predictions.

Description: The machine learning model has been developed using the logistic regression algorithm and trained on a large dataset of patients with and without diabetes. The model takes into consideration various factors such as age, BMI, blood pressure, and glucose levels, among others, to make accurate predictions.

Features: The diabetes prediction model has several features, including:

Dataset: The model has been trained on a dataset that includes patient information such as age, BMI, blood pressure, and glucose levels, among others.

Logistic Regression: The model uses the logistic regression algorithm, which is a popular machine learning algorithm used for binary classification problems.

Data Visualization: The project uses the matplotlib and seaborn libraries to visualize the data and gain insights into the relationships between the different variables.

Accuracy Score: The model's accuracy is evaluated using the accuracy_score metric, which measures the percentage of correct predictions made by the model.

Conclusion: The diabetes prediction model developed using logistic regression is a valuable tool that can help individuals and healthcare professionals predict the likelihood of a person having diabetes. By taking preventive measures and seeking timely medical assistance, individuals can manage their condition and improve their overall health.


#Installation Steps:

Install Anaconda or Miniconda distribution based on your operating system.
Open the Anaconda prompt (Windows) or terminal (Mac/Linux).
Create a new environment using the command: conda create --name diabetes-prediction
Activate the new environment using the command: conda activate diabetes-prediction
Install the required packages using the command: conda install pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn jupyter

Running Steps:

Open the Anaconda prompt (Windows) or terminal (Mac/Linux).
Navigate to the directory where you have saved the Jupyter notebook file for your project.
Activate the environment using the command: conda activate diabetes-prediction
Start Jupyter notebook using the command: jupyter notebook
Open the Jupyter notebook file for your project in your web browser.
Run each cell of the notebook by clicking on the cell and pressing Shift+Enter.
Once all the cells have been executed, you can interact with the model by providing input values and seeing the predicted output.

Note: Make sure to install all the required packages and activate the environment before running the Jupyter notebook file for your project.
